<!-- Nice to e-meet you on my personal website. -->

I research open source governance, corporate open sourcing, user experience design, and other topics in software engineering and information sysmtes.

<!-- Currently finishing up some projects at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg. -->

I am looking for new opportunities in Munich and Berlin after September 2020. I am interested in R&D and software product management. I love software that helps improve individual lives.

As a PhD student in 2016--2019, I worked closely with industry and:

<ul>
  <li>collaborated with 20+ companies, including Facebook, Intel, Software AG, BMW, and Zalando</li>
  <li>aquired €800K+ in research and industry funding</li>
  <li>published 10+ <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cmLxMlQAAAAJ" target="_blank">papers</a> alongside my 447-page <a href="http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:29-opus4-122727" target="_blank">dissertation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- I am based in Nuremberg, Germany.  -->

I am based in Nuremberg, Germany. In the last decade, I also lived in the US, Canada, France, and Armenia. I co-founded the 100+ member NGO <a href="https://enlightngo.org/language/en/about-us" target="_blank">Enlight</a>. I was also nominated for the International Children’s Peace Prize alongside Malala Yousafzai.
